        <ul>
            <li class="websiteNotes" style="text-align: left;">One fun fact about me is that I love to code and drink coffee <br>
            while listening to my favorite music!</li>
            <li class="websiteNotes" style="text-align: left;">My best project so far has been Atlas PDF. <br>
            A program that allows the user to Insert blank pages into PDF files,<br> merge PDF files, and split one file into multiple files.</li>
            <li class="websiteNotes" style="text-align: left;">The best way to reach out to me is through emailing me at <a href="mailto:atlasprogrammingsolutions@gmail.com" style="color: #7cc3ff"><i>atlasprogrammingsolutions@gmail.com</i></a></li>
            <li class="websiteNotes" style="text-align: left;">My advice to anyone becoming a programmer is to embrace the journey.<br> It's okay to make mistakes - they're only stepping stones to mastering the craft. 
            Stay curious, keep coding consistently, and remember that a true master is an eternal student.</li>
        </ul>

            <li class="additionalInfoBoxes" style="text-align: left"><h3><u>Why I do what I do</u></h3>I am a programmer today because my dream 
                has always been to work from home and be with <br>
                my family as much as possible. Programming has been the one thing I've done that I naturally <br>
                seem to understand and enjoy. It's not only become my career, but also one of my favorite hobbies.  </li>
            <li class="additionalInfoBoxes" style="text-align: left"><h3><u>Free-lance Development</u></h3>I'm also a <em>free-lance</em> programmer, providing programming services to those who may need it. <br>
                Those services include the devlopment of programs to automate your daily tasks,
                the creation<br> of web-based apps, and much more. Click on my <a href="" style="color: #7cc3ff"><i>Portfolio</i></a> to see some of my most noteable work! </li>

        <div class="whatIdo">
            <h3 style="text-align: left"><u>Who I am and what I know</u></h3>
            <p style="text-align: left">Born and raised in the vibrant landscapes of South Florida, I have ventured into the realm of programming and have been exploring this fascinating field for over a year now.<br>
                With experience spanning over 1,000 dedicated hours, I am adept at leveraging Python, C++, and Java, with additional proficiency in HTML and CSS to create user-centric solutions. <br>
                My core strengths lie in automating processes using Python, constructing purposeful programs with C++ and Java, and creating intuitive web applications through a blend of Python, HTML, and CSS.<br>
                I am proud to have made significant contributions to law firms by creating valuable software tools. My most notable projects include an interactive PDF program capable of streamlining the handling of<br> 
                documents and a versatile bulk renaming tool, both tailored to enhance efficiency. Moreover, the foundation of my work philosophy is that I tailor code in a way to pioneer success for my clients.<br>
                Being the son of an IT entrepreneur, I've spent two enriching years assisting in my father's IT business, Aramistech, where I honed my skills and gained practical insights into the world of technology. <br>
                With the dream of seeing numerous businesses benefit from programs designed by me, I am driven to create robust software solutions that address diverse business needs.<br>
                Guided by my passion and inspired by my future aspirations, I am on a continuous journey to innovate, create, and lead in this ever-evolving world of technology.</p>
