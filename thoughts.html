        My thoughts on this project. To preface, my dad runs his own IT business and my mom is a web designer. <br>
        Now after doing this project and having gathered experience as a programmer. My goal within the next <br>
        few weeks is to fully establish atlasprogrammingsolutions.com as my business website. The rest will <br>
        be in God's hands. I am grateful for this project as it has given me the opportunity to learn and grow in <br>
        HTML, CSS, and a little bit of Javascript. To me, this class and project specifically was nothing short of the <br>
        beginning of the rest of my career as a programmer. I believe that now having built out this website, I'll be able<br>
    to show both employers and my own future clients the value that I can provide to help their business needs and <br>
    advance myself in my own life as well. I can't wait to see the journey that lies ahead.

    Thank you for everything professor!<br>
    You were awesome!
