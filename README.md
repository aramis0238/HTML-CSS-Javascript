# AtlasProgrammingSolutions
This is the first rendition of my portfolio website!
It was my final project for my Web Authoring class and was graded with 100%. 
I felt that it was too crude and made quite a few more improvements to my current version of the site. 
Feel free to check it out at "atlasprogrammingsolutions.com"!
