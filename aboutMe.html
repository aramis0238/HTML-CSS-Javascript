            <h3 style="text-align: left"><u>Everything About Me</u></h3>
            <p style="text-align: left"></p>Born and raised in the vivid landscapes of South Florida, my journey into the captivating world of programming began over a year ago. Since then, I have devoted more than 1,000 hours to honing my craft, gaining proficiency in languages such as Python, C++, Java, HTML, and CSS. This dedication to my craft is driven by an unwavering commitment to develop user-focused solutions that enhance productivity and efficiency. <br><br>
            My portfolio includes a collection of significant projects, the most impactful of which was a custom mass calculator program for a prominent law firm, now being used by 75% of the company. Tailored to their specific needs, this project has been a testament to my ability to understand client requirements and deliver software solutions that truly make a difference.<br><br>
            My work is also characterized by a keen focus on automation. I've developed tools that streamline operations and improve workflows. Notably, the atlasPDF program and a bulk renaming tool have been key in transforming how law firms manage and organize their documents. atlasPDF allows users to modify PDFs, including inserting blank pages, merging multiple documents, or splitting one into several. The bulk renaming tool helps users manage their files more efficiently by renaming multiple files according to their specifications.<br><br>
            Raised in a family with a rich history in IT entrepreneurship, I've had the opportunity to immerse myself in the world of technology from a young age. Over two years, I worked alongside my father at Aramistech, where I contributed to maintaining IT operations for over 15 companies, troubleshooting problems, and ensuring the smooth functioning of their technological infrastructure.<br><br>
            Looking ahead, my ambition is to grow my own business, Atlas Programming Solutions, into a full-fledged programming company, and work on larger, more complex projects that will continue to stretch my programming skills. I am particularly interested in the areas of web-app development, mobile app development, and automation. Driven by this passion, I aspire to continue creating robust software solutions that address diverse business needs, guided by the dream of seeing numerous businesses benefit from my work.<br><br>
            In this dynamic, ever-evolving world of technology, I am inspired by the future and what it holds. I am on a continuous journey to innovate, create, and lead, driven by my passion for programming and a firm belief in the transformative power of technology.</p>
